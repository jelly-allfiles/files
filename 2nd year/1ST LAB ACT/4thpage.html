        <p>In my perspective, ocean conservation and the Scarborough Shoal issues between China and the Philippines demonstrate that the protection of our Oceans and seas are critical for the health of our planet and its well-being of humanity. The role of oceans in climate regulation, food supply, livelihood provision, and biodiversity conservation is significant. They are exposed to a variety of dangers, such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction.
            While the issues about the Scarborough Shoal,a disputed territory in the South China Sea, are a source of tension between China and the Philippines. China's actions have caused concerns about its intentions and restricted access to the area for Filipino fishermen, resulting in economic hardship. </p>
        
        <p>The dispute is connected to the preservation of ocean resources and the importance of the shoal as a valuable fishing ground. The Philippines has called for a peaceful resolution and China to respect international law. <br>
            To sum it up, the conservation of our oceans is crucial for both the health of our planet and the well-being of humanity. 
            The Scarborough Shoal dispute reveals the difficulties faced by ocean conservation and the necessity for international cooperation to protect marine resources and guarantee the sustainable use of the oceans.</p>
