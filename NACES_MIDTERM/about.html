                <p>A casual gamer is someone who irregularly plays games or who only plays a single low-intensity game. <br>An example of a casual gamer would be someone who plays word or puzzle games on their smartphone while on public transportation or at home while watching TV. 
                <br>Casual gaming is the largest portion of the gaming market due to its wide appeal and the ease of access provided by smartphones. A casual gamer would often not self-identify as a gamer.
                <br>A hardcore gamer is someone who regularly plays video games. <br>They usually own dedicated video game devices, such as consoles or gaming PCs. 
                <br>A hardcore gamer often plays many games but focuses on one game or type of game they particularly enjoy. A hardcore gamer usually self-identifies as a gamer.</p> 
                
                <div class="list">
                <h3>Equipment List</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Good internet connection</li>
                        <li>Desktop or Laptop</li>
                        <li>Streaming software</li>
                        <li>Camera</li>
                        <li>Microphone</li>

                    <p>A professional gamer is someone who makes money or supports themselves by playing games. Some are e-sports athletes who play video games at a professional level in tournaments. They may be part of a team or clan and play in broadcasted events.
                    <br> They may make money from tournament prize pools and from corporate sponsorships.       
                    <br>They usually focus on only a single game. Another type of professional gamer is a streamer. 
                    <br>A streamer makes money by posting videos of them playing games. These videos are often done live and put on Twitch or YouTube.</p>

                <h3>Cost</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Budget. </li>
                        <li>Desktop or Laptop.</li>

                        <li>Minimum specs.</li>
                        <li>CPU.</li>
                        <li>Graphics Card (GPU). </li>

                    <p>They make money from viewer donations, sponsorships, and ad revenue.
    	            <br>While these are the traditionally accepted categories of gamers, there is no definitive way to classify all gamers, and these categories are skewed toward traditional gaming culture. <br>For example, a retired woman who plays a farming or Sudoku game on her iPad for many hours 
                    <br> a day would be considered by many people a casual gamer, although she probably plays video games for more hours a month than a traditional hardcore gamer.
